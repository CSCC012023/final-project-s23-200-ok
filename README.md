# Playbook

 

## The ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù

Want to chat with your gamer friends? Use Discord.

Want to check out how your gaming skills compare to theirs? User Tracker.gg.

Want to share your in-game achievements? Use gaming forums.

Want to FIND new gamer friends? Good luck using social media!

There is no SINGLE social networking platform that caters its user experience towards online multiplayer gamers, and acts as a central hub for them to find new people to play with, to chat with, and to share in-game achievements with.

## The ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù

Playbook is a one-stop shop solution for online multiplayer gamers. The platform allows gamers to share their in-game stats such as ranks, position, and play-style, and streamlines the process of finding new people to play with based on the in-game information that truly matters for each game. Playbook also allows gamers to post pictures and clips of their in-game achievements.
