## **Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect**

- When: June 14, 2023
- Where: Online on Discord Voice Call

## **Process - Reflection**

### **Decisions that turned out well**

- **Decision 1**: Decision to use MERN stack because it is beginner friendly and easy to setup for students who have never used it before. Also, the fact that we learned React in tutorial helped.
- **Decision 2**: Implementing profile and login first as it is lays the foundation for developing subsequent functionalities app.
- **Decision 3**: Having additional meetings, stand-ups (5+), and text-based communication kept all team-members informed and on-track throughout the sprint.

### **Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped**

- **Decision 1**: Insufficiently thorough planning led to overlapping dependencies between tickets, causing duplicated effort.
- **Decision 2**: We should have collaborated more on tickets/features that were on the same page of the application for duplicate effort
- **Decision 3**: Although the additional standups were good to have, **daily** standups were too frequent, and didnâ€™t give developers enough time to make meaningful progress (due to other academic commitments).

### **Planned changes**

- **Change 1**: We will enhance our planning phase by dedicating more time to breaking down user stories and assessing potential overlaps and dependencies which will help us make sure that work is not duplicated and time is not wasted.
- **Change 2**: We will encourage more collaboration on tasks that relate to the same page or feature of the application. This should help mitigate the risk of duplicated effort, and create a better understanding within the team.
- **Change 3**: Instead of having standup every day, we will have it every other day while keeping in touch more frequently with other teammates that are working on similar features.

## **Product - Review**

### **Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:**

- **Goal/Task 1**: Registration
    - Code is on github
    - JIRA ticket is complete
- **Goal/Task 2**: Log in
    - Code is on github
    - JIRA ticket is complete
- **Goal/Task 3**: Profile
    - Code is on github
    - JIRA ticket is complete


### **Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:**

- **Goal/Task 1**: Connecting profile to user
- **Goal/Task 2**: Connecting social accounts to profile (frontend logos are completed)

## **Meeting Highlights**

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

1. **Improved Collaboration**: We have understood the importance of closer collaboration between team members, particularly when working on related features. We plan to encourage frequent communication and knowledge sharing to avoid duplication of effort.
2. **Effective Planning**: We've realized that more thorough planning is crucial in preventing overlaps and maximizing productivity. In our next iteration, we will dedicate more time to better break down our tasks and understand their dependencies.
3. **Balanced Communication**: While daily standups helped us keep updated on progress, they also proved to be a bit too frequent and interruptive. Our experience in this iteration highlighted the need for a balance between constant communication and giving team members enough uninterrupted time to make meaningful progress.
4. **Shared Understanding**: The issues of overlapping work also highlighted the importance of having a shared understanding within the team not only about the tasks but also the overall project goals.
