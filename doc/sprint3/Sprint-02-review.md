## **Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect**

- When: June 19
- Where: Online on Discord Voice Call

## **Process - Reflection**

### **Decisions that turned out well**

- **Decision 1**: Fragmentation of functionality: This helped in segmenting various tasks to different team members efficiently so that all the other stories in the same sprint did not rely on one story.
- **Decision 2**: More collaboration and communication among team members resulted in facilitated problem-solving.
- **Decision 3**: Finishing Posts and LFG as it allowed us to focus on a variety of different stories so that stories barely depended on each other for Sprint 3

### **Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped**

- **Decision 1**: Although we did split up the functionality, we could have definitely split it up even more as we had certain features on hold until other features were completed
- **Decision 2**: We initially planned for standups every other day, but due to time constraints we ended up having to do daily standups again
- **Decision 3**: A lot of merge conflicts had to be fixed last minute due to a lack of updating feature branches frequently

### **Planned changes**

- **Change 1**:  Since we have a good amount of the application done now, we should have very little crossover/dependencies between stories, this time we will try to have everyone working on completely independent parts of the app so that the amount of waiting is reduced
- **Change 2**: We will continue to do daily standups, the first person each day to do their standup will notify everyone so that nobody forgets to do their standup for the day
- **Change 3**: We will try to merge develop into our feature branches much more frequently to prevent any last-minute git issues

### **Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:**

- **Goal/Task 1**: Video Posts: The initial estimate for video posts turned out to be too ambitious for a single story. We divided it into two stories for text/image and video, adhering to INVEST principles.
- **Goal/Task 2**: viewing reactions also took slightly longer than expected so we split it up into 2 stories, one for viewing the reactions and one for creating the reactions

## **Meeting Highlights**

1. **Independent Stories**: We aim to further separate tasks and work on independent stories to minimize crossover and dependencies.
2. **Frequent Updates**: More regular merging and updates are essential to prevent last-minute merge conflicts.
3. **Improved Communication**: Continued emphasis on daily standups and reminders to ensure everyone remains updated on progress.
4. **Even More Collaboration**: We saw how much our efficiency improved by increasing collaboration, so we will keep that above and even try to improve it
